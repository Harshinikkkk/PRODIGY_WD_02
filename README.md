# PRODIGY_WD_02
A stopwatch project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features a simple timer with "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons. HTML creates the structure, CSS styles the layout, and JavaScript manages the timer logic with `setInterval`. Clicking "Start" begins the timer, "Stop" pauses it, and "Reset" clears the time. This project demonstrates basic time tracking and DOM interaction.
